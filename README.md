### About:
The Auction System is a simple auction application built with JavaFX. It allows users to list items for auction and bid on items.

The frontend of the application is designed using the Material FX library. In order to run the application, users will need to have Java 8 or above installed, as well as an Azure Storage account and the Google Gson and Material FX libraries. The application can be set up by cloning the repository, setting up the required libraries and dependencies, and running the main method in the Main.java file.
